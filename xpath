xpath grammers:


tools:  
1. xmllint  --xpath
For these, more complex, XPath expressions, we can explore the correct syntax
using some command-line tools. The xmllint command-line utility is probably
already available on your Linux system, and has an --xpath option to perform
queries on XML files.

2. Another option, providing nicer outputs, is the xpath command from the
libxml-xpath-perl Debian/Ubuntu package:
$ sudo apt-get install libxml-xpath-perl
$ xpath -e "//record[@id='res_partner_kanban_view']" -e
"//field[@name='display_name']]" /path/to/*.xml
